arcum42/angband

This is a loose branch of the vanilla Angband tree, and tracks the Vanilla tree
as closely as possible. The purpose of this tree is to work on redoing the gtk port, as I think it's due for a revamp, and I believe I'm a better programmer then when I originally wrote the current code.

I may also add other ports, such as a wxwidget port, if I feel inclined. Given that my first priority on coding is the pcsx2 project, this is likely to mainly be worked on when I need a change of pace, so commits may be erratic.

First priority is getting a basic port implemented. One window, no choice of fonts, and no graphics. Gradually, I'll bring in the ability to have other windows, change fonts, have graphics and sound, etc.

Then can come more advanced features, like buttons, extra windows (which may or may not include the ones currently in the main gtk port. Depends on how I feel about it at the time), and so on.

Currently I'm sticking with C, but if C++ looks cleaner, I might use it. If that happens, I'll be sure to limit to files in the port, though, unless the main program starts going to C++.
